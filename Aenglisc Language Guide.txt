The Aenglisc language is spoken, obviously, in Aengland as well as its former colonies of Ginnaecer, Skamisc
and Uilscyr, and to a lesser extent in Gidan and Firgene.
It is a descendent of OTL Old English / Anglo-Saxon, with much less French influence since William the
Conqueror never was "the Conqueror" - he lost the Battle of Hastings and retreated to Normandy.

This file is intended to give a guide to meanings and pronunciations. For any people knowledgeable about
Old English and/or linguistics, this is not meant to be a 100% realistic construction with accurate or
consistent sound changes, so don't jump down my throat! Many of these are actually unchanged from OTL
OE anyways.

Letter-sound correspondences which differ from our general English today:
(Use this website to hear any of these IPA sounds: https://www.ipachart.com/)

a = /ɑ/ almost invariably
ae = /æ/, roughly like the "a" in our word "cat"
ea (when a diphthong) = /e/, similar to the final vowel in "play", but without the /ɪ/ at the end
i = /ɪ/, like the "i" in "hit, bit"
y = /i/, like the "ee" in "meek"
u = /u/ or /ʊ/ like in "boot" or "put" respectively
sc = /ʃ/, our letters "sh"
h (when not following to a "t") = /x/ or /ç/, similar to how a generic Scotsman might say "Ach!"
th = /ð/ intervocalically, otherwise /θ/ - the second is the normal English "th" and the first is voiced
c = /k/ except before /i/ or /ɪ/, in which case it's /tʃ/, like our letters "ch"

Countries, their pronunciations (in IPA then approximated in the ugly American phonetic system) and meanings:

- Aengland - ['æŋlɑnd]. Demonym Aenglisc is thus /'æŋlɪʃ/ (similar to the pronunciation of "anguish", but, ya know, with an L)
- Ginnaecer - [dʒɪ'nækɚ] or if you prefer [dʒɪ'neɪkɚ], "Jin-ACK-er"
		(ɚ is your average American word ending in -er)
	Ginn - wide/spacious, aecer - field
- Skamisc - ['skɑmɪʃ] "SKAH-mish"
	Borrowed from local Native Amerigans
- Gidan - ['gɪdɑn] "GID-on"
	- Origin and meaning unclear
- Firgene - ['fɪɹgɛnə] - roughly "FEARG-en-uh"
	Likely a conflation of some native word with an Aenglisc word for "mountains"
- Uilscyr - ['wɪlʃiɹ] - "WILL-shear"
	Uilsc - foreigner (akin to our word "Welsh"), scyr - shire/land -- This because of the significant
		Francophone and Hispanophone populations in the country
