The Heirs to Aquitania
A total conversion mod by Savs
Based on the HtA megacampaign

Features a new world with nearly 800 years of different history (mostly as determined by the computer in CK2 and EU3)
Development has been in fits and spurts since June 2014. The mod is based on /gsg/Vickymod v1.06, which was popular at that time. It is not based on PDM, nor on HPM/HFM.
If you want to contact me, find me on reddit as /u/Savolainen5 or on the Paradox forums as Savolainen5

Also check out http://www.reddit.com/r/savs, where history and other stuff are posted. However, please direct discussion about the mod to the thread as much as possible, in keeping with Paradox rules.

**CHANGELOG**

Version 0.36 X/Y/20 - The Russias & China Update

*Major*

- Story and flavour for Russia and Smolensk
	-Final resolution of the two-state problem in Russia via war
	-Expansion to the Pacific coast of Asia
	-Expansion into central Asia
	-Expansion against the Baltics
- Events and decisions for China by /u/chortlinggnome, see changelog below.
- Events and decisions for the Outremer Question by /u/capitanloco6 - A united France can take on Persia to gain control over land at the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
- Incorporated HPM's crisis locking system and election event spam reduction system
- HtA story chain regarding Corsica involving Aquitania, PDN, and Naples/Italy
- Blobby decision added to get cores on most of the European Western Mediterranean as a Romance country
- Added a de-escalation event after the Eyjafjallajokul eruption and subsequent famine which SHOULD cut down on the number of rebels. But expect to see many countries of Europe fall to them still. That's more or less what I want
- Added lots more soldier and craftsman POPs to normal GPs, did some industrial boosting
- Story chain for Outremer POPs in Persia to revolt and a strong France to intervene on their behalf (Thanks to capitanloco6)
- Story chain for Arab/Mashriqi revolts in Persia (Thanks to ChortlingGnome)
- Adapted the HPMmm (map modded) fancy map to HtA, made some important province movements (see Map Changes below)
	- Note: I don't think there are, but there might still be some provinces which lost their port/naval base because of this. Let me know if you find one.

*Minor*

**Decisions**
- Added a decision for Margaria/Ginnaecer (or conceivably some other country) to expand into Oai (typically the last state to be colonised in NA)
- Added decisions to colonize the often-empty states of Newea and Necen in NA
- Added a decision to annex Silesia after it has been puppeted by the Secure Silesia decision
- Tweaked/added decisions for Naples/Italy to better deal with Tuscany and getting cores on the Padan Union, thanks to Spudgun
- Tweak/fix for decision for forming SGF so that it works
- Greece now will declare war on the Roman Empire in the Roman Civil War as soon as war with Anatolia begins, rather than waiting for 20 military score
- Incorporated decision for Norway to claim some Caribbean islands, courtesy of /u/Flapjack731. Thanks!
- Transcaucasia formation decisions are only available when Railroading is off
- The Oheskewen canal now has stricter requirements for construction - you must either own the province yourself, or your vassal must
- Forming Bohemia-Hungary now removes Bohemia cores
- Armenia will move its capital to Erivan when it loses Yerzenka
- Small chain of decisions/events for GNC and SKM to eat CLF

**Events**
- Expanded Margaria's expansion events to include more commonly-empty provinces
- Added an event for any NA country which has borders on a coreless empty province to get a random event to own that province. SAVS THINKS THIS SHOULD BE MADE TO BE A REAL cOLONY PROVINcE, NOT A STATE
- Added an event for France to get cores on Brittany if it doesn't have them and to change the province names to the French ones
- Added an event for the Celtic Federation (CLT) owning Brittany to revert names from possible French names to Breton ones
- Added a number of flavour events
- The Treaty of Szekes gives signatories cores on the provices they get from Bohemia, Bohemia keeps its cores in Moravia and isn't releasable
- PDN can get cores on VEN even if someone snipes Venice first, like Crushric likes to do when playing as BAV

**The world**
- To get an alliance, you need a minimum 50 relationship with the target country
- Added some relationships from the EU3 save
- Updated some diplomacy
- Gave some Persian provinces to Azerbaijan to better reflect the state of the world
- Forum user Discux made tons of new party names for the Amerigas, added them. Thanks!
- Improved Scandinavian parties per over421's recommendations/suggestions
- Small party policy changes for Naples/Italy
- UBD no longer has Estonian as a primary
- Updated a bunch of flags, with special thanks to Athemos
- Italian (that is, south_italian) added as an accepted culture to Sicily
- Modified the Cherokee country colour
- Made Don Cossacks exist from game start as Smolensk puppet for inclusion in Russia stuff
- Improved some OOBs, added some missing ones
- Adjusted POPs in a number of places with the above in mind
- Added some Sephardic POPs to Aquitania and Ashkenazi to SOME of France. Needs more - ALWAYS
- Tweaked POP migration a bit, taking inspiration from HPM
- Added a flag for New World countries which helps with the above (and an event to assign it if it's not there from the beginning)
- Gave a number of countries different ideals
- Made lots of vassals at game start into substates so that the Acquire Substate State cb can be used against their overlords
- Gave Hispania the port of Penang on the Malay Peninsula
- Renamed and adjusted some provinces in Russia, central Asia
- Renamed some provinces in New Holland and the surrounding seas
- Renamed a couple of provinces in Aengland and replaced lots of wheat with sheep in the southeast
- Added island terrain types from HPM and so changed a bunch of terrain to small islands
- Added the colormaps from HPM Map Modded, which makes it way fancier looking, and made SOME adjustments. Still lots of work to be done (see the To-Do list)
- Started incorporating the physical map from the above

**Other**
- Tweaked POP migration targets to improve migration to low-population provinces and MajorMajor added culture-based migration targets (Iberians are more likely to go to former Iberian colonies etc.)
- Some Luxembourg buffing
	- Added Wallonian to accepted cultures of Luxembourg
	- Added a fun cheese decision for a GP Luxembourg to get cores on all of France, Wallonia, and Germany (and it will get Central German as an accepted culture)
	- Added a second fun cheese decision to follow to get cores on Netherlands and accept Dutch. You must hold some French cores and some German cores in order to take the decision
- Localisation file consolidation
- Halved POP growth bonus for Steenkooler republics
- Halved MIL and CON gain during famine from volcano
- Tweaked the population growth maluses for Disaster Damage and Fire Recovery event modifiers
- Changed the name of Romania to Volasea (as a sort of quasi-plausible development of Volcae/Vlach/Wallach into something that isn't Romania, because, you know, Romans exist)
	- The new tag is VOL, though I haven't changed other things, like party name codes, regions, or the culture code
- Tweaked the colour of Central German culture to be more distinguishable from North German
- Lots more tweaks

*Bugfixes*

- Zachadia can no longer form Poland
- Tweaked Zachadia formation to work better, no longer relies on the enacter only holding its own cores
- For real fixed the Brunswick Congress Chain. All this time I've been missing the fact that there was a global flag which was missing an underscore and so it wasn't matching with an event trigger
- Evangelos Melisurgos dies properly now. Credit to /u/PaumCharmoso for pointing it out
- Fixed the form SGF decision to actually work. Thanks to /u/Hirotsugu for pointing it out
- Russian steppe event no longer spams when annexing Smolensk
- Hispania's OOB works
- Fixed and greatly improved the German Hegemony CB

*China/Japan content changelog by /u/chortlinggnome:*
- added event chain for civil war between Qin and Nanyue, pulling in Qin vassals, Mongolia and Manchuria
- added option for Qin to reform government and potentially avoid Warlord period; can be done manually or via political reforms
- SE Asia destiny decision for GXI; cores on Luang Prubang, Cambodia, Champa, Lan Xang, Middag. Dem clean borders doe
- changed Xinhai Rev trigger to avoid reformed QIN, unless reformed QIN loses monarchy.
- added new flags for QIN_monarchy and QIN_republic
- New flags + govt type localisation for GXI 
- Changed localisation for reformed Qin, reformed Qin now uses QIN_republic flag
- Accept Nanfaren decision for reformed QIN 
++ my thought process is that Warlordism should be avoidable with a strong, stable monarchy
++ however, true democracy taking hold will be chaotic just as IOTL
++ reforming QIN will be a challenge - race against time to research or unlock political reforms while MIL builds
++ This all needs playtesting!
- changed Unequal Treaty Decision to apply to non-GPs, removed eligibility for Southeast Asian nations when fighting GXI. This should stop SPs from annexing states
- Removed Portuguese Macao; now goes to random GP early in game as part of Nanyue trade/westernisation agreement
- Changed China decisions to apply Taiping total war conditions for GXI, YNN and MGL
- China Taiping events folder applied to GXI, QIN
- Korean war event / decision chain between China and Japan
- Japan expansion in Ainu Mosir and Taiwan
- Removed Chinese cores from North Jiangxi - 1545, 1546, 1549, 1551. Regainable during Qin Civil War
- Localisation for Middag parties switched to generic
- added Hakka as accepted culture to GXI to increase stability in early game 

*Map changes*
- Mostly copied en masse the coasts and islands of all the world from HFMmm
- Three provinces (9, 12, 43) from the far north of Canada moved down to the Ginnaecer-Margaria border area
- Three provinces (8, 10, 44) from the far north of Canada moved to Persia for treaty ports for the event chain to dismantle Persia
