Planning and ideas for 0.37

Poland:
- Something with the Sejm
	- Liberum veto never crippled Poland like it did OTL (think of some history, do some research)
	- If there's an elective monarchy, foreign king possible?
- Flavour events
- Black sea stuff?
- Oppose GER formation?
- Pressure BYZ to form Romania/Volasea, either as an independent or by attacking Ardeal to make a vassal Volasea?
- Ruthenians?
- Make sure that claims are not wonky

- Homeland for the Jews in the region?
	- Some country declares itself protector?
	- Balfour declaration type which presents options?

Italy:
- Rework PDN formation?
	Some sort of conference thing
- Rework NPL->ITA. Perhaps some sort of Mezzogiorno-like country
- Italy as a formable for the whole peninsula but only under specific circumstances and before a certain time:
	- NPL falling to Albesan rebels gives a temporary CB to conquer Italy and then form it? (MajorMajor)
	- PDN breakup gives NPL an opportunity to unite the peninsula
- PDN-NPL war with each seeking allies
	- GP on PDN's side declares war on NPL with some wargoal and peaces out by decision when PDN's war ends.
		- Problem: NPL allies might agree to fight PDN, but not the GP
- When NPL's European holdings are taken by BYZ, make some event to make their holdings revert to someone (roman_italians decision)
	- Also see what changes need to be made to the relevant decisions in Hta_RomanEmpire in general
	- Check the form_italy_without decision in NationalUnification
	- Make sure there aren't pan-nationalist rebels or something
		
		
Other:
- France eats Wallonia?
- Keep refining the Outremer and Near East files (like there was that one player who had a truce with Persia but wasn't involved in the war, but still got stuff)
- Make the crisis stopping event work even more. Event 60168 in crises.txt
- See if rebelspam can be reduced by stealing rebel code from HPM/HFM?
- Remove/rework SGF formation (esp. localization)
- Add some decisions for Qin/Nanyue as detailed here https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-heirs-to-aquitania-altervicky-mod.895808/page-54#post-27043143
- Stuff from this post: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-34#post-22477778 --- Mostly done, need to double check that the fix for the NET-NAL war WAD
	Should there be a better justification for Wallonia and its being integrated into the Greater Netherlands
- Hispania and Navarra from this post: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-34#post-22485910
- Doublecheck that Alba colonies in Indonesia go to all countries correctly
- Make hills work
- Perhaps have some European response to the end of the RUS-SML conflict - big threat in the east!
- Solve BRU attacking NET to get Emden
- Make some stuff for PER to give up its treaty ports even when it peacefully gives up JER
- Change some colours in the EGY-PER-JER-CYR-MGH continuum
- Possibly add a decision or something to reduce RUS core POPS' MIL and CON when SML annexes them, so there aren't the rebels.
