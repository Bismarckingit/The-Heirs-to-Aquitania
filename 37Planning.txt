Planning and ideas for 0.37

Poland:
- Something with the Sejm
	- Liberum veto never crippled Poland like it did OTL (think of some history, do some research)
	- If there's an elective monarchy, foreign king possible?
- Flavour events
- Black sea stuff?
- Oppose GER formation?
- Pressure BYZ to form Romania/Volasea, either as an independent or by attacking Ardeal to make a vassal Volasea?
- Ruthenians?
- Make sure that claims are not wonky

- Homeland for the Jews in the region?
	- Some country declares itself protector?
	- Balfour declaration type which presents options?

Italy:
- Rework PDN formation?
	Some sort of conference thing
- Rework NPL->ITA. Perhaps some sort of Mezzogiorno-like country
- Italy as a formable for the whole peninsula but only under specific circumstances and before a certain time:
	- NPL falling to Albesan rebels gives a temporary CB to conquer Italy and then form it? (MajorMajor)
	- PDN breakup gives NPL an opportunity to unite the peninsula
- PDN-NPL war with each seeking allies
	- GP on PDN's side declares war on NPL with some wargoal and peaces out by decision when PDN's war ends.
		- Problem: NPL allies might agree to fight PDN, but not the GP
		
		
Other:
- France eats Wallonia?
