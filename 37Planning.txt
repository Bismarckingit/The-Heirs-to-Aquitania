Planning and ideas for 0.37

Poland:
- Something with the Sejm
	- Liberum veto never crippled Poland like it did OTL (think of some history, do some research)
	- If there's an elective monarchy, foreign king possible?
- Flavour events
- Black sea stuff?
- Oppose GER formation?
- Pressure BYZ to form Romania/Volasea, either as an independent or by attacking Ardeal to make a vassal Volasea?
- Ruthenians?
- Make sure that claims are not wonky

- Homeland for the Jews in the region?
	- Some country declares itself protector?
	- Balfour declaration type which presents options?

Italy:

- Rework NPL->ITA. Perhaps some sort of Mezzogiorno-like country
- Italy as a formable for the whole peninsula but only under specific circumstances and before a certain time:
	- NPL falling to Albesan rebels gives a temporary CB to conquer Italy and then form it? (MajorMajor)
	- PDN breakup gives NPL an opportunity to unite the peninsula
	- Consider also the ability of ITA to accept Cisalpine
	- ITA reverts to NPL if they hold neither Rome nor Reggio?
		- Same for dismantlement - it's one or the other
- PDN-NPL war with each seeking allies
	- GP on PDN's side declares war on NPL with some wargoal and peaces out by decision when PDN's war ends.
		- Problem: NPL allies might agree to fight PDN, but not the GP
- When NPL's European holdings are taken by BYZ, make some event to make their holdings revert to someone (roman_italians decision)
	- Also see what changes need to be made to the relevant decisions in Hta_RomanEmpire in general
	- Check the form_italy_without decision in NationalUnification
	- Make sure there aren't pan-nationalist rebels or something

-Sicilian party names		
		
Other:
- Keep refining the Outremer and Near East files (like there was that one player who had a truce with Persia but wasn't involved in the war, but still got stuff)
- Make the crisis stopping event work even more. Event 60168 in crises.txt
- See if rebelspam can be reduced by stealing rebel code from HPM/HFM?
- Remove/rework SGF formation (esp. localization)
	- Also fix GER formation and dismantlement. Weird stuff like Old Croatia sticking with Germany, cores remaining on BOH land even after it regains the provinces -- BOH given a new_bohemia flag when it reforms, use that to trigger the loss of non-BOH cores
		- GER gets vanilla-type cores, EWWW
- Add some decisions for Qin/Nanyue as detailed here https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-heirs-to-aquitania-altervicky-mod.895808/page-54#post-27043143
	- QIN/GXI suffers from the situation where GXI must be ahead of you in westernisation as QIN, but that doesn't happen because reactionary rebels. See what GeneralTownes wrote on Discord
- France eats Wallonia?
- Stuff from this post: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-34#post-22477778 --- Mostly done, need to double check that the fix for the NET-NAL war WAD
	Should there be a better justification for Wallonia and its being integrated into the Greater Netherlands
- Hispania and Navarra from this post: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-34#post-22485910
- Doublecheck that Alba colonies in Indonesia go to all countries correctly
- Make hills work
- Perhaps have some European response to the end of the RUS-SML conflict - big threat in the east!
	- Finnish intervention during the Russia war? Roman?
- Make some stuff for PER to give up its treaty ports even when it peacefully gives up JER
- To get an alliance, you should need a minimum 50 relationship with the target country - Why isn't this working?
- A way for Roman Empire to get Trebizond, perhaps something eventy in tandem with ARM moving its capital to the east
- Consider revamping some AEN decisions, esp. wrt IRE
- Add some negative modifier for feudal (European) countries?
- MAKE SURE THAT NPL COLONIAL HOLDINGS MATCH LORE
- Look into the Free Latvia CB and who can use it
- Uncivs should not get the First Minister event stuff
- GNC stays at war forever with CLF for some reason? One reddit user reported that, and because of it they couldn't complete the event chain as SKM with GNC
- Make some way for BOH to avoid the Partition War
- Are disease events stronger/more frequent than in vanilla? TBG and Jorde think so
