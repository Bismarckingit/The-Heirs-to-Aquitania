To Do, as of v0.37

Events:

- Make CBs for war events work so that there's a more elegant solution than reducing infamy
- Teralarga ideas: see Suggestions
- Some kind of country/nationalism for Solelha in Florida
- Dissolution of Maghreb (see suggestions)
- Generic event to annex countries that you have full cores on, as happens with Rome sometimes
- Give Puppet CBs to owners of territory in India in the mid-late 1800s?
- Made event 2610 (National Assimilation) in CBsandCores happen only after 1870, but would it be better to find some way to make it so that it doesn't fire when primary culture POPs of the country whose core would be removed are present? I looked into that and did some quick theorycrafting but couldn't come up with a good way to do it

Decisions:

- Japan claims Ainu Mosir and the northern islands (the latter decision exists already and has merely been disabled)
- Imperial ambitions for Georgia
- Owner of Saorvaile in Africa can get Bopolu by event
- Owner of Liberia strongarms Mali into giving further inland parts or something. Currently Mali doesn't even hold them
- check NationalUnification to see if the Arab Union needs to have the relevant culture group excluded in order to be able to form
- A union of Margaria and Vestland
- Caliphate claims and stuff like that: Egypt is the best claimant, but maybe Persia and maybe Maghreb? Mali?
- SHC accepts some neighbouring cultures if they hold their territory?
- Indian cultures: Accept Dravidians, Assamese, Kashmiri
- Korea goes after Manchuria

POPs:

- Increase POPs in the super-low-POP countries like SKM, MDT, YKT, KZH, YUC
- Reduce POPs in Vestland, Margaria, Hoyekysten because there aren't a lot of Scandinavians to migrate to these countries
- Orthodox minorities in the Middle East, Armenian heartland, see http://i.imgur.com/7uVsYh4.png
	-Esp. of Armenian culture. Perhaps split it into an Islamicized ruling class and a rural Christian peasant one? (Credit to TBG on Discord)
	- Armenia: Split into Arabized (more urban?) Armini and non-Arabized (more rural?) Hayastani/Hay
- POP rework in the former KOJ, per Glocky's suggestion on Discord and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8pc0PkaZaQ
- Adjust POPs in USR - Fewer in the south (as in Brazil today), more in the north around the capital, more Guarani in Paraguay/Brazil
- Remove Andean POPs from the southern part of Inca?
- Boost POPs of Uganda and Rwanda regions which have had their province size increased?
- Add some Turkmen folks (maybe minorities) in Syria
- Similarly to the above, add some sort of Turkic POPs in the Armenia-Persia area to represent remnants of Seljuks
- Add a few more aristocrats to Holland and Friesland

Militaries:
- Navies for much of the world
- Central American countries
- Uilscyr, after POP adjustment
- Ensure that all countries with a military start with something on their capital

Localisation:
- In general, modify non-HtA events so they fit the world as is.
- Parties for Wallonia, Brabant, lots more
- Finish renaming provinces and regions in Australia, New Zealand
- Rename sea provinces as needed around the world, especially in the New World
- Rewrite Death of Emperor Iesada event to reflect the situation on the ground

Map:
- Trade ports in Japan for Naples, Alba and/or others? Added a small port in v0.31 for Netherlands - do something with that in the Japan update
- Mess with overall region/province shapes in Africa so they're less OTL-y
- Make provinces conform better to new RDS rivers. Especially Khiva-Persia
- Fix the hill terrain - Why doesn't it WAD? Why doesn't it even exist? How the heck does the terrain sheet work, anyways? Should some other terrain map be brought in and adapted to the HtA map?
- Some provinces are alone in their state, which makes them NOT tempting targets (like Cherkoee's northern provinces) - Do something about this
- Tunis has some cores on uncolonized land?
- Make some desert provinces in the Middle East have not 35 LR because that's ridiculous. Or just think about it some more - is there any reason a 3k POP province shouldn't have 35LR? It's not like their POP is gonna boom, it's a desert province!
- Central and South American LR - make more than 30
- Make the Oheskewen Canal have its own province and also make the chain to build it more similar to modern canal event chains

Flags: More about this can be found in the "List of small things to be done" on the forum (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-5#post-20555393)
- In general, any flag suggestions are welcome, particulary for vanilla countries

CB:
- Incorporate /u/sdrasmu4's split conquest CBs? The only trouble is that maybe the AI would be bad at using it and that would mess up balance
- Increase badboy decay since war is meant to be more widespread?
- Restrict Europeans' CB potentials on NA uncivs

Other:
- Go back through eventually and add newspaper entries
- FIX THE BLOODY ECONOMY - remember the guy who was a GP Dabimon and had a REALLY hard time gathering goods for military?
	- Incorporate this patch for the interest bug: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/global-event-to-force-rax-refunds.1377441/ and/or https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/does-the-national-bank-still-have-the-interest-bug.1393731/
- One day in the future: Incorporate (some of?) PDM MAYBE - Spices for Indonesia would be nice anyways
- Nerf nationalist/pan-nationalist rebels somehow - Especially German pan-nationalists 
- Factionalism in the Philippines (Panaja) with several different states on different islands fighting each other, either during or after Dutch rule
- Dismantlement seems to hand out random provinces to individual countries when it should do like... States or something.
- Add POP Migration Mod? https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria2/comments/2mtl11/pop_migration_mod_hod
- Add Better AI Mod?https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/better-ai-mod.925608/#post-21373359
- KoJ revived with a reverse oriental crisis over protection of holy sites/lands? (Partially done in 0.36 - does it need revisiting/refinement?)
- KoJ/OUT stuff as suggested here https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-heirs-to-aquitania-altervicky-mod.895808/page-55#post-27126827
- Fascism happen sooner?
- More to be done with rebels wanting to break free of Italy in the north?
- Look into tweaking migration so that it's more likely to happen toward neighbouring countries Dictatorship > Democracy
- Buff population growth, especially in the new world (will partly be solved by increasing LR)
- If more iron is needed, add the Alegria iron mine to prov2442 (Monduroi) in USR? The problem is that it opened in 1992
- Nerf migration to CLF and SKM due to their remoteness? Necessary? Too realistic?
- Indian accepted cultures: should include Gujarati, should have a way to accept Dravidians
- Research can be finished well before the end of the game. One player finished in 1924
- Revamp canals to be more along HPM lines, and get rid of the Dividends events because they're ugly (also need to rename the one that's still called the Panama Canal Dividends)

- What happens with the Hungarian event chain if Bohemia becomes a democracy?
- Make Hungarian Pamphlets event state-level so it's less spammy?
- Ardeal forms some union of Hungarian and Volasean peoples
- Sort out Transylvania - North German POPs: Were there Transylvanian Saxons?
- Trans-Hungary for Hungarian-Romanian interaction, particularly in Transylvania

- Consider adding a naval base to one of the Balearic Islands
- Portugal claims Atlantic islands
- Decision/event for HIS to accept Basques

- Remove unused countries more systematically
- Event/Decision to try to mediate Germany?
- Revisit that ability of German states to not attend the Brunswick congress - AI will currently always attend
- Tweak Bavarian choices for Brunswick Congress so they're better
- Saxony making problems for Brandenburg when it attends the Brunswick congress and is still a BOH ally.
- Small event chain to change Wallonia into some other country which accepts Picard (or to separate Wallonia and Picardy)
- France takes back Challans (La Roche, 437) from AQT
- AQT decision reclaim SA colonies if they're lost
- Being puppetmaster of Livonia gives you the possibiltiy to incorporate Estonia into it?
- Post-revolution Bohemia gets a hold of Syrmia and the Banat
- Craftsmen in Europe (which is less industrialised than vanilla)
- Add more Jews throughout Europe! (Partly done, needs more)
- Add more minorities in Europe on the other side of borders
- Too many German POPs?

- When Austria is released after dismantlement, it got OTL cores. Why? Fix!

- Springtime of Nations should hit Roman Empire harder?
- Danubian Federation-thing for Roman Empire
- Some Autokrator grants a constitution?
- Massive problem for the Roman Empire if they fail to take Rome, or if they lose it.
- Decisions for Roman Empire to conquer Levant, Italy, restore Imperial Borders
	- Move capital back to Rome and assimilate/accept lots
	- Roman Empire can reconquer Rome and get Italian and Sicilian added as accepted, and/or assimilation
	- See the ideas from Crushric - Look in Suggestions.txt
	- Event/decision for, when it has conquered all of Armenia (make this easier?), crack down on Armenians or risk wrath of military?
- Greece rejoins a democratic Roman Empire? Buff ANA in that case
- Or, RCW runs a different course if the Empire is already democratic via Albesans
	- Romans struggle to keep Greeks and Anatolians in check - regionalism
- Make sure BYZ revolter tags actually build militaries- ANA stuff:
	- Move capital to Constantinople
	- Greek accepted OR better assimilation (what would be the policy vis-a-vis Armenians?)
	- Focus more on Anatolian expansion
	- Absorb Georgia?


	0.45 (China):

- HPM nerfs and other systems
- China: Demand Concession CB gives 0 infamy when there are no valid targets
- Punitive expedition mechanic to get trade ports in Qin instead of demand concession CB
- Readd Mahayana in China, since all Mahayana were changed to Confucian
- A GP with power in the area can get Hong Kong somehow if they aren't the one that got Macao
- Maybe the country that buys Macao shouldn't sphere such a huge country as Nanyue?
QIN reports from https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-heirs-to-aquitania-altervicky-mod.895808/page-54#post-27034539 :
- growth of liberal population was too high. About time when i westernized i had like 40-50% of my population being liberals. It meant that when i passed reform, it Decreased my militancy.
- There is no way or at least i didn't find any to annex my sub-states.
- There is no decision to core most/all of China or became China as Qin. Decision to reform Qin Empire could do that job with harder prerequisites.
- Decision for accepting Baifaren?/Southern Han culture is hard to get because of militancy requirement. Can we have another decision to accept Min/Yue/Zhuang/Hakka cultures?
- Unity national value is bit OP with 50% of assimilation bonus which means it can assimilate core cultures if you know what i mean.
- Event for serial killer is popping too many times.
- Unequal Treaty events for Nanyue, tweak it for Qin
- Unequal Treaty includes Nanyue VN land

	0.46 (SEA/Indonesia):

- Sikkim's Indian status (probably shouldn't necessarily be a part of India since it's more Himalayan in character and doesn't have the same political forces as OTL)
- Burma missing a core on Pegu
- Regions in the Siam-LPBG-LXA-CAM area
- Competition for colonies in SEA, especially between NAP and HIS in the Malay peninsula

	0.52 (MRG, VST)
- Union of these two countries
- Anti-slavery CB against MRG, especially after their decision restart_slave_trade - needs checking, and the war name from this CB might not be localized
- Rework Afro-American cultural names, and culture in general

	0.61 (MNK,MDT,HOY)
- Rework Panaben Canal stuff (especially event 97392)

	Lonca/Argentina (0.66/0.67)
- Rework/improve southerly expansion (Consider looking at code from HPM or whatever)
- Mess with the Argentinian Andes. Maybe give Lonca more control over them. That way, Argentina doesn't so easily get a crazy snaky shape up into Inca

Savs, remember that Birth of a Nation is in CleanUp and has the ID 60160
