- Saxony making problems for Brandenburg when it attends the Brunswick congress and is still a BOH ally.
- Danubian Federation-thing for Roman Empire
- Some Autokrator grants a constitution?
- Massive problem for the Roman Empire if they fail to take Rome, or if they lose it.
- Small event chain to change Wallonia into some other country which accepts Picard (or to separate Wallonia and Picardy)
- What happens with the Hungarian event chain if Bohemia becomes a democracy?
- Make CBs for war events work so that there's a more elegant solution than reducing infamy

- Competition for colonies in SEA, especially between NAP and HIS in the Malay peninsula
- Generic event to annex countries that you have full cores on, as happens with Rome sometimes
- Give Puppet CBs to owners of territory in India in the mid-late 1800s?

Decisions:

- Take a second look at forming Italy and how to do it so that the now-split-off Italian cultures
- France takes back Challans (La Roche, 437) from AQT
- Japan claims Ainu Mosir and the northern islands (the latter decision exists already and has merely been disabled)
- AQT decision reclaim SA colonies if they're lost
- Decisions for Roman Empire to conquer Levant, Italy, restore Imperial Borders
	- Move capital back to Rome and assimilate/accept lots
	- Roman Empire can reconquer Rome and get Italian and Sicilian added as accepted, and/or assimilation
	- See the ideas from Crushric - Look in Suggestions.txt
	- Event/decision for, when it has conquered all of Armenia (make this easier?), crack down on Armenians or risk wrath of military?
- Imperial ambitions for Georgia
- Post-revolution Bohemia gets a hold of Syrmia and the Banat
- Owner of Saorvaile in Africa can get Bopolu by event

- A union of Margaria and Vestland
- A GP with power in the area can get Hong Kong somehow if they aren't the one that got Macao
- Korea goes after Manchuria
- Ardeal forms some union of Hungarian and Volasean peoples

POPs:

- Craftsmen in Europe (which is less industrialised than vanilla)
- Readd Mahayana in China, since all Mahayana were changed to Confucian
- Increase POPs in the super-low-POP countries like SKM, MDT, YKT, KZH, YUC
- Reduce POPs in Vestland, Margaria, Hoyekysten because there aren't a lot of Scandinavians to migrate to these countries
- Orthodox minorities in the Middle East, Armenian heartland, see http://i.imgur.com/7uVsYh4.png
- POP rework in the former KOJ, per Glocky's suggestion on Discord and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8pc0PkaZaQ
- Adjust POPs in USR - Fewer in the south (as in Brazil today), more in the north around the capital, more Guarani in Paraguay/Brazil
- Remove Andean POPs from the southern part of Inca?
- Boost POPs of Uganda and Rwanda regions which have had their province size increased?
- Add some Turkmen folks (maybe minorities) in Syria
- Similarly to the above, add some sort of Turkic POPs in the Armenia-Persia area to represent remnants of Seljuks
- Change the French in the Holy Land to Outremer or Levantine or whatever
- Add more Jews throughout Europe! (Partly done, needs more)
- Add more minorities in Europe on the other side of borders
- Too many German POPs?
- Add a few more aristocrats to Holland and Friesland
- Sort out Transylvania

Militaries:
- Navies for much of the world
- Central American countries
- Uilscyr, after POP adjustment

Localisation:
- In general, modify non-HtA events so they fit the world as is.
- Parties for Wallonia, Brabant, lots more
- Finish renaming provinces and regions in Australia, New Zealand
- Rename sea provinces as needed around the world, especially in the New World
- Rewrite Death of Emperor Iesada event to reflect the situation on the ground

Map:
- Trade ports in Japan for Naples, Alba and/or others? Added a small port in v0.31 for Netherlands - do something with that in the Japan update
- Mess with the Argentinian Andes. Maybe give Lonca more control over them. That way, Argentina doesn't so easily get a crazy snaky shape up into Inca
- Mess with overall region/province shapes in Africa so they're less OTL-y
- Do some province reshaping and add another province in the border region between AQT and NAV
- Make provinces conform better to new RDS rivers. Especially Khiva-Persia
- Fix the hill terrain - Why doesn't it WAD? Why doesn't it even exist? How the heck does the terrain sheet work, anyways? Should some other terrain map be brought in and adapted to the HtA map?
- Some provinces are alone in their state, which makes them NOT tempting targets (like Cherkoee's northern provinces) - Do something about this
- Tunis has some cores on uncolonized land?

Flags: More about this can be found in the "List of small things to be done" on the forum (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-5#post-20555393)

CB:
- Incorporate /u/sdrasmu4's split conquest CBs? The only trouble is that maybe the AI would be bad at using it and that would mess up balance
- China: Demand Concession CB gives 0 infamy when there are no valid targets
- Increase badboy decay since war is meant to be more widespread?
- Restore monarchy CB?
- Restrict Europeans' CB potentials on NA uncivs
- Punitive expedition mechanic to get trade ports in Qin

Other:
- Go back through eventually and add newspaper entries
- FIX THE BLOODY ECONOMY - remember the guy who was a GP Dabimon and had a REALLY hard time gathering goods for military?
	- Incorporate this patch for the interest bug: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/global-event-to-force-rax-refunds.1377441/ and/or https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/does-the-national-bank-still-have-the-interest-bug.1393731/
- Add silk/wine-related industry to PRE
- One day in the future: Incorporate (some of?) PDM MAYBE - Spices for Indonesia would be nice anyways
- Nerf nationalist/pan-nationalist rebels somehow - Especially German pan-nationalists 
- French general staff - special political leader as a buff for them (already added a strong attack general)
- Factionalism in the Philippines (Panaja) with several different states on different islands fighting each other, either during or after Dutch rule
- Hispania loses cores on countries in time?
- Union in Iberia?
- Italy tag replaced with something like Mezzogiorno, reserve Italy for a unification of PDN and Naples-Rome?

- Add Better AI Mod?https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/better-ai-mod.925608/#post-21373359
- KoJ revived with a reverse oriental crisis over protection of holy sites/lands? (Partially done in 0.36 - does it need revisiting/refinement?)
- Fascism happen sooner?
- More to be done with rebels wanting to break free of Italy in the north?
- Look into tweaking migration so that it's more likely to happen toward neighbouring countries Dictatorship > Democracy
- Give Brabant more land/outposts to explain how they got New Caledonia
- Nerf colonial migration? (There was the case of Blackhog's insane Suez colonial migration)
- Buff population growth, especially in the new world
- If more iron is needed, add the Alegria iron mine to prov2442 (Monduroi) in USR
- Nerf migration to CLF and SKM due to their remoteness? Necessary? Too realistic?
- ANA stuff:
	- Move capital to Constantinople
	- Greek accepted OR better assimilation (what would be the policy vis-a-vis Armenians?)
	- Focus more on Anatolian expansion
	- Absorb Georgia?
- RCW runs a different course if the Empire is already democratic via Albesans
	- Romans struggle to keep Greeks and Anatolians in check - regionalism
- Indian accepted cultures: should include Gujarati, should have a way to accept Dravidians
