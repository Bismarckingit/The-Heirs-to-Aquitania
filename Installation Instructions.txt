If you downloaded a .rar (from the official forum, for example): Extract the .mod and the folder to Programfiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod

If you downloaded HtA from Github:

1. Put the folder this file is in (probably called The-Heirs-to-Aquitania-Master) into your game files' mod folder (the Programfiles(x86) path mentioned above).
2. Rename the folder to The Heirs to Aquitania (Note - make sure you use spaces between the words, not dashes)
3. Take the .mod file (it might look like a movie file of some kind for you) and put it in the same place as the HtA folder.

In the end, it should look like this: https://imgur.com/a/eKLRl2P

Map modding option: If you want a slightly darker political colormap, go to map/terrain and rename political_colormap_HFMmm to just political_colormap and get rid of (or change the name of) the current political_colormap. The default one looks a bit better in my opinion.
