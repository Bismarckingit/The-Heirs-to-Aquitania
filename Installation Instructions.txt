- If you downloaded a .rar (from the official forum, for example): Extract the .mod and the folder to Programfiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod

- If you downloaded HtA from Github: Put the folder this file is in into your game files' mod folder. Take the .mod file (it might look like a movie file of some kind for you) out and have it also be in the mod file next to the Heirs to Aquitania folder.
If you're using Steam, the target directory is gonna be Programfiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod. So, to be clear, in the end you'll have an Heirs to Aquitania folder and an Heirs to Aquitania .mod
file both in your Vic2 mod folder with the aforementioned path. Rename the mod's folder to The Heirs to Aquitania (because it's probably something like The-Heirs-to-Aquitania-...). If the mod's folder is not called (without quotation marks) "The Heirs to Aquitania", the mod will not launch.

Map modding option: If you want a slightly darker political colormap, go to map/terrain and rename political_colormap_HFMmm to just political_colormap and get rid of (or change the name of) the current political_colormap. The default one looks a bit better in my opinion.
