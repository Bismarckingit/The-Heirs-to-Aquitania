SML
- War with BYZ for some reason, if they win they can free the S. Slavs
- Intervene on behalf of Anatole in civil war?
- Make it so that Ukraine isn't a country but there's something else

RUS
- Continue south into C. Asia - conflict with Persia (maybe better done in Persia)


TO DO BEFORE RELEASE:

-Doublecheck that Alba colonies in Indonesia go to all countries correctly
-See if rebelspam can be reduced by stealing rebel code from HPM/HFM?



############Finished stuff############

Make forming BHN remove BOH cores
Write events to get the rest of NA states just because it's annoying they aren't being colonised
Nerf Steenkooler growth modifier (reduced global pop growth modifier from 0.1 to 0.05. Maybe that'll do it?
- Event/decision to sphere Kazakh Khanate and Cossack Hetmanate
- Why can't it just  attack Russia immediately? Allies? Power of the church in favour of Russia?
- SML has precarious peace with the nomads like cossack, kazakh (and someone else?), which makes them less powerful than they appear
